# Summary:
  ## I. Data Exploration
  1) Images exploration
  2) Labels exploration
  ## II. Data Preprocessing
  1) Formatting the dataframe,
  2) Data pipeline 1: Defining functions loading images and feeding images (model.fit used for 1st model)
  3) Data Pipeline 2: Feeding models with batches of images (model.fit_generator used for 2nd, 3rd and 4th model)
  ## III. Building and training neural networks
  1) 1st Neural Network
  2) 2nd Neural Network
  3) 3rd Neural Network
  ## IIV. Predictions on test data
  ## Conclusion
